<!--Start with a screen that explains the game and how the user will input their choices.   
Each step is visible only after the previous step has been successfully completed. 
Present a start button.  
Step 1: The user enters the number to start with. Then they click the Enter button.  
Step 2: The user enters the number to finish with. Then they click the Enter button. 
Step 3: Print Sweet, Salty, Sweet'nSalty, and the numbers to the screen as the user instructed.  
Step 4: Print the total number of Sweet, Salty, and Sweet’nSalty after printing the numbers and words. 
Step 5: After all the numbers have been printed, present a button allowing the user to delete everything and restart. 
Instructions
As always: 
When the number is a multiple of three, print “Sweet” instead of the number 
If the number is a multiple of five, print “salty” instead of the number.  
For numbers which are multiples of three and five, print “Sweet’nSalty” instead of the number. 
The difference in this project is that you will use JS to manipulate the DOM and print the numbers and words to the web page (NOT the console). 
This will be a single page application that takes the user through the following steps by displaying and not displaying text and instructions.  
Each line will be displayed one at a time.  
“Please enter a starting number” 
“Please enter a final number” 
“Please press enter to display your results.” 
You will start with only the template html (an empty <body>) 
You will add, delete, and alter elements exclusively using JavaScript DOM manipulation as the user moves through the steps.  
You must display each step separately one at a time, while not displaying the other steps.  
You must have styling using INTERNAL (not inline) styling.(inside head inside style) 
This means you will have to plan ahead for class/id names to pair with pre-created (by you) CSS rulesets. 
Then, you will apply those class/id names to the elements dynamically using DOM manipulation. 
The start and stop numbers must be validated to be at least 200 apart and no more than 10,000 apart. 
You also will implement input validation to verify that only positive numbers are entered and that the start number is less than the stop number. 
There will be 40 numbers on each line, except the last line. 
The numbers printed to the browser page must be formatted correctly (12,453) 
Every “Sweet”, “Salty”, and “SweetnSalty” printed must have a green background with white text.  
You will have small, red text that pops up under the input box to explain what the user did wrong while presenting that step again. 
After printing the numbers to the screen, you will allow the user to click a ‘Reset’ button to erase everything and do it all again.  -->
