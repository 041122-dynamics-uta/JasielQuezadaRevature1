Dads and Grads
First I had to figure out who was a dad and who was a grad. It says Stephanie went to the senior prom with Michael’s son.
That means they are not related and that Steph is a grad and Michael is a dad. Next Elias and James played on the school’s baseball team. One of them is Alberto’s son. That means Alberto is a dad and Elias and James are grads. Laslty Michael and Elias are not related. Which means that Michael is James father and Alberto is Elias father.
