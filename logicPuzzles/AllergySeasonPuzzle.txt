Allergy Season
First I made a table and put the names down one collum and allergies in the top row. The first clue says Allegra has a food allergy. That eliminates pollen, bee stings, and cats leaving her only with shellfish and nuts. Next Ben can play with his kitten for hours without issue which means he is not allergic to cats. Next Claraâ€™s allergy is not related to animals, which eliminates cats, shellfish, and bee stings. Next Flora has seasonal allergies which only gives her pollen. With those marked out Zach is the only one with a box open for cats so that is his allergy. Clara then is the only one that has a box open for nuts so that is her allergy. Ben is allergic to bees becuase he is the only one left with the bee box open and Allegra is allergic to shellfish.
