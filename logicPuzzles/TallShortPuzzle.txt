Tall to short
The first clue says Weldon is taller than Delia but shorter than Zina 
So I wrote them in a list in this order Zina, Weldon, and Delia 
The next clue says Leisha is taller than Benito but shorter than Delia and Weldon
So I put them at the bottom of the list under Delia in the order Leisha than Benito
So now I have Zina, Weldon, Delia, Leisha than Benito. The last clue says Benito is not the shortest  
Which only leaves Charlotte so I put her at the bottom
